Timberwolf's Roads
==================

A UK-inspired road type featuring several eras and types of road 
from unpaved tracks to motorways.

- 2x sprites for all road types
- Electrified road and tramway with catenary
- Automatic handling of left-hand/right-hand traffic
- Random variations and custom town centre graphics

You may also be interested in Timberwolf's UK Road Vehicles for 
2x zoom vehicles that fit with the roads in this set, and take
advantage of the new features introduced.

Getting Started
---------------

The set does not introduce too much complexity on top of the
existing OpenTTD road mechanics. The important things to be aware
of:

* Roads have speed limits, with earlier roads being slower
* The faster a road is, the more expensive it will be to
  construct and maintain.
* Towns are not able to build houses alongside the fastest
  road types (A roads and motorways)
* Towns will only build 30mph road types.
* Most vehicles are unable to run on unpaved dirt tracks

Early Start Notes
-----------------

Early on you will only have access to unpaved tracks, eventually
getting access to sett roads.

Towns founded before sett roads are available will build roads
using cobbles intended for horses, which are impassable by regular
road vehicles. This means as the game progresses, you will have
inaccessible historic town centres, which need to be avoided or
redeveloped. (Or you can use trams to carry things through the
historic district)
